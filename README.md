# ðŸ‘¾ Gamedex

Hello world! My internet name is Suboptimal and I am an Indian software engineer. Gamedex is the repo where I keep track of my game dev + computer graphics experiments. I also post the demos on ðŸ‘‰ [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/SuboptimalEng) so feel free to follow me there!

All of the experiments are web-based and built with Next.js + Three.js + Tailwind CSS so running them locally is super easy. Here's an example of how you can run the `solar-system` animation:

```
git clone https://github.com/SuboptimalEng/Gamedex.git
cd Gamedex/solar-system/
npm install
npm run dev
```
